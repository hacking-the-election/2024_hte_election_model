## 2024 HTE Election Model
The HTE election model and website for the 2024 presidential election employs poll aggregation and generates 50,000 random simulations to fully analyze and 
break down this election's trends, countours, and odds on both the state and national level. 

It includes an election map, histogram, and a "What-If" feature employing Bayseian inference that allows adjustment based on hypothetical state calls on election night.
